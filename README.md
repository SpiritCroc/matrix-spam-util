## Useful tips

To temporarily disable wlan on your phone while the script is running:

```
adb shell svc wifi disable ; ./spam.py -m 2 ; adb shell svc wifi enable
```

or use `android_cold_start.sh` which also kills and re-launches your app, and launches `logcat` (you probably want to adapt the script's `grep` call for your app though!).
